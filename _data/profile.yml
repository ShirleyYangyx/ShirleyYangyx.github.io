    I am a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University. Previously, I was a Research Fellow at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. 
    I received my Ph.D. in Information Security from Jinan University in 2023, supervised by Prof. Jian Weng. 
    During my Ph.D. studies, I was a visiting researcher at the University of Surrey and Newcastle University in the UK.

  <p>
    My research focuses on applied cryptography, secure multiparty computation, and privacy-preserving data analysis, 
    with particular emphasis on private set intersection, secure genomic data processing, and cryptographic protocols with strong security guarantees. 
    My work has been published in leading security and privacy venues, including NDSS, PETS, ACNS, ACSAC, and IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing.
