    I am a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Previously, I was a Research Fellow at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. 
    I received my Ph.D. in Information Security in 2023 from Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, supervised by Prof. Jian Weng. 
    During my Ph.D. studies, I was a visiting researcher at the University of Surrey and Newcastle University in the UK.

  <p>
    My research focuses on applied cryptography, secure multiparty computation, and privacy-preserving data analysis, 
    with particular emphasis on private set intersection, cryptographic protocols with strong security guarantees, and secure medical data processing. 
    My work has been published in leading security and privacy venues, including NDSS, PETS, ACNS, ACSAC, IEEE TDSC, and IEEE TIFS.
